# Covert Location Advisor (CovLoc)
Code for WebRes 2015/16 Sprint 1 by Team T9.

Covert location advisor using Google Maps API.

## About
Uses NodeJS and Express to run the server, use `npm init` to pull in dependencies, then node server.js to run.

Server will listen on port 8080 by default, and will serve requests at root. Simple API runs at `api/1/algorithms`, which is used by the client to populate available algorithms and add them to an internal object.
